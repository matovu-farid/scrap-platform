# Webhooks

Enhance your integration with real-time event handling using webhooks. In this section, you'll find:

## Setup Instructions

1. Configure your webhook URL in your scrap-ai dashboard or when initiating a scrape job.
2. Ensure your server is set up to receive POST requests at the specified URL.
3. Implement logic to handle and process the incoming webhook data.

## Event Triggers

Webhooks are triggered for the following events:

- `job.completed`: Fired when a scraping job is successfully completed.
- `job.failed`: Fired when a scraping job encounters an error and fails.
- `job.progress`: Fired periodically to update on the progress of a long-running job.

## Security Considerations

To secure your webhook endpoints:

1. Use HTTPS for your webhook URL to encrypt data in transit.
2. Implement webhook signature verification to ensure the authenticity of incoming requests.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(digest));
}
</CodeBlock>

## Troubleshooting & Advanced Options

If you're not receiving webhook events:

1. Check that your webhook URL is correctly configured and accessible.
2. Verify that your server is properly handling POST requests.
3. Check your server logs for any errors in processing webhook data.

For advanced webhook configuration, you can:

- Set up retry logic for failed webhook deliveries.
- Implement a queueing system to handle high volumes of webhook events.

<Callout type="warning">
  Always handle webhook events idempotently, as the same event may be sent multiple times in rare cases.
